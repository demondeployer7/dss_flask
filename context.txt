I will give you instructions stepwise , go through the instructions properly :

1. Now I want to use flask as the backend not streamlit
2. I want to store the user entered data in a database rather than using a csv file
3. i will prefer to use sql alchemy to store data
4. all the pkl files have been converted to json format , take care of that 
5. you need not load pkl files now , load json
6. make the code modular for the group size , do not hard code the number of group members as 8 or 5 , let the user enter it 
7. user credentials are stored in users.csv, store that as well in a database
8. no interaction with github to store data
9. store data in database not a csv file
10. use sqlalchemy as database
11. use postman for testing 
12. give a proper working code

ask if you have any other doubts 
create a new file flask_app.py
logic and flow will be same fo the flask app as well (same as app.py)
no github interaction
create any other files or directories required in the folder flask app data
